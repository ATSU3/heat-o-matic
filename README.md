# Lazycook

A proportional integral derivative (PID) controller that will be used to run a home-made immersion circulator. PID is a fancy way of saying that the code plays a game of 'Warmer', 'Colder' to get something to a value set using the UI. There is no doubt that that internet is littered with examples of these things, so it is primarily a didactic exercise that will use a few bits of code we've previously developed, and make us a little smarter along the way.

# Hardware

Raspberry Pi Pico + SSD1351 Waveshare OLED + Rotary Encoder + temperature sensor + a plug socket 

**Warning: Don't generate heat using something that dislikes being power-cycled a lot. Something something NO WARRANTY**

# Installing it onto a Pico

[rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell) is going to be the way to do it. I vaguely recall there being a minor complication. Check notes. 

# Using it

Plug it in, pop the temperature probe into the medium you are going to heat, plug the heat-providing device into the plug socket, pick a setpoint. Done.

# Video of it running

From GitHub to GutGrub. Thank you, thank you, I'm here all week, don't forget to tip your waitress.

# Contributing to the code

If you look at this and think it needs improving, fork it and make it better.
