A Pico PID controller that will be used to run a homebrew immersion circulator.

Pico or Pi + OLED + Rotary Encoder + plug socket

Pi has the benefit of being able to do loads of fancy stuff (web server, nice graphics etc), pico is more self-contained. Does a PID really need a web server, or to be able to email you to tell you your steak is ready?
