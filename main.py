# main.py - a script for making a temperature regulating PID, running using a Raspberry Pi Pico
# First prototype is using an OLED, rotary encoder and a relay switch (linked to heating device of some sort)
# The display relies on drivers made by Peter Hinch [link](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-nano-gui)
